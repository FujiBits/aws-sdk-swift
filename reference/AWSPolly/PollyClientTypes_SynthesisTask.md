# PollyClientTypes.SynthesisTask

SynthesisTask object that provides information about a speech
synthesis task.

``` swift
public struct SynthesisTask: Swift.Equatable 
```

## Inheritance

`ClientRuntime.Reflection`, `Swift.Codable`, `Swift.CustomDebugStringConvertible`, `Swift.Equatable`

## Initializers

### `init(from:)`

``` swift
public init (from decoder: Swift.Decoder) throws 
```

### `init(creationTime:engine:languageCode:lexiconNames:outputFormat:outputUri:requestCharacters:sampleRate:snsTopicArn:speechMarkTypes:taskId:taskStatus:taskStatusReason:textType:voiceId:)`

``` swift
public init (
            creationTime: ClientRuntime.Date? = nil,
            engine: PollyClientTypes.Engine? = nil,
            languageCode: PollyClientTypes.LanguageCode? = nil,
            lexiconNames: [Swift.String]? = nil,
            outputFormat: PollyClientTypes.OutputFormat? = nil,
            outputUri: Swift.String? = nil,
            requestCharacters: Swift.Int = 0,
            sampleRate: Swift.String? = nil,
            snsTopicArn: Swift.String? = nil,
            speechMarkTypes: [PollyClientTypes.SpeechMarkType]? = nil,
            taskId: Swift.String? = nil,
            taskStatus: PollyClientTypes.TaskStatus? = nil,
            taskStatusReason: Swift.String? = nil,
            textType: PollyClientTypes.TextType? = nil,
            voiceId: PollyClientTypes.VoiceId? = nil
        )
```

## Properties

### `debugDescription`

``` swift
public var debugDescription: Swift.String 
```

### `creationTime`

Timestamp for the time the synthesis task was started.

``` swift
public var creationTime: ClientRuntime.Date?
```

### `engine`

Specifies the engine (standard or neural)
for Amazon Polly to use when processing input text for speech synthesis. Using a
voice that is not supported for the engine selected will result in an
error.

``` swift
public var engine: PollyClientTypes.Engine?
```

### `languageCode`

Optional language code for a synthesis task. This is only necessary if
using a bilingual voice, such as Aditi, which can be used for either
Indian English (en-IN) or Hindi (hi-IN).
If a bilingual voice is used and no language code is specified, Amazon Polly
uses the default language of the bilingual voice. The default language for
any voice is the one returned by the <a href="https:â€‹//docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/API_DescribeVoices.html">DescribeVoices operation for the LanguageCode
parameter. For example, if no language code is specified, Aditi will use
Indian English rather than Hindi.

``` swift
public var languageCode: PollyClientTypes.LanguageCode?
```

### `lexiconNames`

List of one or more pronunciation lexicon names you want the service
to apply during synthesis. Lexicons are applied only if the language of
the lexicon is the same as the language of the voice.

``` swift
public var lexiconNames: [Swift.String]?
```

### `outputFormat`

The format in which the returned output will be encoded. For audio
stream, this will be mp3, ogg\_vorbis, or pcm. For speech marks, this will
be json.

``` swift
public var outputFormat: PollyClientTypes.OutputFormat?
```

### `outputUri`

Pathway for the output speech file.

``` swift
public var outputUri: Swift.String?
```

### `requestCharacters`

Number of billable characters synthesized.

``` swift
public var requestCharacters: Swift.Int
```

### `sampleRate`

The audio frequency specified in Hz.
The valid values for mp3 and ogg\_vorbis are "8000", "16000", "22050",
and "24000". The default value for standard voices is "22050". The default
value for neural voices is "24000".
Valid values for pcm are "8000" and "16000" The default value is
"16000".

``` swift
public var sampleRate: Swift.String?
```

### `snsTopicArn`

ARN for the SNS topic optionally used for providing status
notification for a speech synthesis task.

``` swift
public var snsTopicArn: Swift.String?
```

### `speechMarkTypes`

The type of speech marks returned for the input text.

``` swift
public var speechMarkTypes: [PollyClientTypes.SpeechMarkType]?
```

### `taskId`

The Amazon Polly generated identifier for a speech synthesis task.

``` swift
public var taskId: Swift.String?
```

### `taskStatus`

Current status of the individual speech synthesis task.

``` swift
public var taskStatus: PollyClientTypes.TaskStatus?
```

### `taskStatusReason`

Reason for the current status of a specific speech synthesis task,
including errors if the task has failed.

``` swift
public var taskStatusReason: Swift.String?
```

### `textType`

Specifies whether the input text is plain text or SSML. The default
value is plain text.

``` swift
public var textType: PollyClientTypes.TextType?
```

### `voiceId`

Voice ID to use for the synthesis.

``` swift
public var voiceId: PollyClientTypes.VoiceId?
```

## Methods

### `encode(to:)`

``` swift
public func encode(to encoder: Swift.Encoder) throws 
```
