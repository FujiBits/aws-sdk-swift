    Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for
    developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of
    this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required
    infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these
    advantages, Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted, thus effectively
    helping you to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more quickly.
    As a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. Batch automatically
    provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific
    workloads. With Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus
    your time and energy on analyzing results and solving your specific problems.
