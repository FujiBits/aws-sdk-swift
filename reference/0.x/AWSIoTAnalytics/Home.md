# Protocols

  - [IoTAnalyticsClientProtocol](/aws-sdk-swift/reference/0.x/AWSIoTAnalytics/IoTAnalyticsClientProtocol):
    IoT Analytics allows you to collect large amounts of device data, process messages, and store them.
    You can then query the data and run sophisticated analytics on it.  IoT Analytics enables advanced
    data exploration through integration with Jupyter Notebooks and data visualization through integration
    with Amazon QuickSight.
