    The Amazon Chime API (application programming interface) is designed for developers to
    perform key tasks, such as creating and managing Amazon Chime accounts, users, and Voice
    Connectors. This guide provides detailed information about the Amazon Chime API,
    including operations, types, inputs and outputs, and error codes. It also includes some
    server-side API actions to use with the Amazon Chime SDK. For more information about the
    Amazon Chime SDK, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime/latest/dg/meetings-sdk.html">
    Using the Amazon Chime SDK
    in the Amazon Chime Developer Guide.
    You can use an AWS SDK, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), or the REST API to make API calls. We recommend using an AWS SDK or the
    AWS CLI. Each API operation includes links to information about using it with a language-specific AWS SDK or the AWS CLI.
