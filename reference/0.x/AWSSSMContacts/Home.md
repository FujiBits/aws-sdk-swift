    Systems Manager Incident Manager is an incident management console designed to help users
    mitigate and recover from incidents affecting their Amazon Web Services-hosted applications.
    An incident is any unplanned interruption or reduction in quality of services.
    Incident Manager increases incident resolution by notifying responders of impact,
    highlighting relevant troubleshooting data, and providing collaboration tools to get
    services back up and running. To achieve the primary goal of reducing the
    time-to-resolution of critical incidents, Incident Manager automates response plans
    and enables responder team escalation.
