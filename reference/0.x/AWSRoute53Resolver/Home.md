# Protocols

  - [Route53ResolverClientProtocol](/aws-sdk-swift/reference/0.x/AWSRoute53Resolver/Route53ResolverClientProtocol):
    When you create a VPC using Amazon VPC, you automatically get DNS resolution within the VPC
    from Route 53 Resolver. By default, Resolver answers DNS queries for VPC domain names
    such as domain names for EC2 instances or Elastic Load Balancing load balancers.
    Resolver performs recursive lookups against public name servers for all other domain
    names.
