## Initializers

### `init(config:)`

``` swift
public init(config: AWSClientRuntime.AWSClientConfiguration) 
```

### `init(region:)`

``` swift
public convenience init(region: Swift.String? = nil) throws 
```

## Methods

### `batchMeterUsage(input:completion:)`

BatchMeterUsage is called from a SaaS application listed on the AWS Marketplace to
post metering records for a set of customers.
For identical requests, the API is idempotent; requests can be retried with the
same records or a subset of the input records.
Every request to BatchMeterUsage is for one product. If you need to meter usage for
multiple products, you must make multiple calls to BatchMeterUsage.
BatchMeterUsage can process up to 25 UsageRecords at a time.
A UsageRecord can optionally include multiple usage allocations, to provide customers
with usagedata split into buckets by tags that you define (or allow the customer to
define).
BatchMeterUsage requests must be less than 1MB in size.

``` swift
public func batchMeterUsage(input: BatchMeterUsageInput, completion: @escaping (ClientRuntime.SdkResult<BatchMeterUsageOutputResponse, BatchMeterUsageOutputError>) -> Void)
```

### `meterUsage(input:completion:)`

API to emit metering records. For identical requests, the API is idempotent. It
simply returns the metering record ID.
MeterUsage is authenticated on the buyer's AWS account using credentials from the
EC2 instance, ECS task, or EKS pod.
MeterUsage can optionally include multiple usage allocations, to provide customers
with usage data split into buckets by tags that you define (or allow the customer to
define).

``` swift
public func meterUsage(input: MeterUsageInput, completion: @escaping (ClientRuntime.SdkResult<MeterUsageOutputResponse, MeterUsageOutputError>) -> Void)
```

### `registerUsage(input:completion:)`

Paid container software products sold through AWS Marketplace must integrate with
the AWS Marketplace Metering Service and call the RegisterUsage operation for software
entitlement and metering. Free and BYOL products for Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS aren't
required to call RegisterUsage, but you may choose to do so if you would like to receive
usage data in your seller reports. The sections below explain the behavior of
RegisterUsage. RegisterUsage performs two primary functions:â€‹ metering and
entitlement.

``` swift
public func registerUsage(input: RegisterUsageInput, completion: @escaping (ClientRuntime.SdkResult<RegisterUsageOutputResponse, RegisterUsageOutputError>) -> Void)
```

``` 
                Entitlement: RegisterUsage allows you to verify that the
                customer running your paid software is subscribed to your product on AWS
                Marketplace, enabling you to guard against unauthorized use. Your container
                image that integrates with RegisterUsage is only required to guard against
                unauthorized use at container startup, as such a
                CustomerNotSubscribedException/PlatformNotSupportedException will only be thrown
                on the initial call to RegisterUsage. Subsequent calls from the same Amazon ECS
                task instance (e.g. task-id) or Amazon EKS pod will not throw a
                CustomerNotSubscribedException, even if the customer unsubscribes while the
                Amazon ECS task or Amazon EKS pod is still running.



                Metering: RegisterUsage meters software use per ECS task,
                per hour, or per pod for Amazon EKS with usage prorated to the second. A minimum
                of 1 minute of usage applies to tasks that are short lived. For example, if a
                customer has a 10 node Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS cluster and a service configured
                as a Daemon Set, then Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS will launch a task on all 10
                cluster nodes and the customer will be charged: (10 * hourly_rate). Metering for
                software use is automatically handled by the AWS Marketplace Metering Control
                Plane -- your software is not required to perform any metering specific actions,
                other than call RegisterUsage once for metering of software use to commence. The
                AWS Marketplace Metering Control Plane will also continue to bill customers for
                running ECS tasks and Amazon EKS pods, regardless of the customers subscription
                state, removing the need for your software to perform entitlement checks at
                runtime.
```

### `resolveCustomer(input:completion:)`

ResolveCustomer is called by a SaaS application during the registration process.
When a buyer visits your website during the registration process, the buyer submits a
registration token through their browser. The registration token is resolved through
this API to obtain a CustomerIdentifier and product code.

``` swift
public func resolveCustomer(input: ResolveCustomerInput, completion: @escaping (ClientRuntime.SdkResult<ResolveCustomerOutputResponse, ResolveCustomerOutputError>) -> Void)
```
