# Protocols

    AWS Snow Family is a petabyte-scale data transport solution that uses secure devices to
    transfer large amounts of data between your on-premises data centers and Amazon Simple Storage
    Service (Amazon S3). The Snow commands described here provide access to the same
    functionality that is available in the AWS Snow Family Management Console, which enables you to
    create and manage jobs for a Snow device. To transfer data locally with a Snow device, you'll
    need to use the Snowball Edge client or the Amazon S3 API Interface for Snowball or AWS OpsHub for Snow Family. For more
    information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSImportExport/latest/ug/api-reference.html">User Guide.
