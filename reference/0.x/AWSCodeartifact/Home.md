# Protocols

  - [CodeartifactClientProtocol](/aws-sdk-swift/reference/0.x/AWSCodeartifact/CodeartifactClientProtocol):
    AWS CodeArtifact is a fully managed artifact repository compatible with language-native
    package managers and build tools such as npm, Apache Maven, and pip. You can use CodeArtifact to
    share packages with development teams and pull packages. Packages can be pulled from both
    public and CodeArtifact repositories. You can also create an upstream relationship between a CodeArtifact
    repository and another repository, which effectively merges their contents from the point of
    view of a package manager client.
