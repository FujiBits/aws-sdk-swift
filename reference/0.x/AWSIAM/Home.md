    Identity and Access Management (IAM) is a web service for securely controlling
    access to Amazon Web Services services. With IAM, you can centrally manage users, security credentials
    such as access keys, and permissions that control which Amazon Web Services resources users and
    applications can access. For more information about IAM, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/iam/">Identity and Access Management (IAM) and the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/">Identity and Access Management User Guide.
