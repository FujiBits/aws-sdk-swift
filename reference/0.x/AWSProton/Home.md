    This is the AWS Proton Service API Reference. It provides descriptions, syntax and usage examples for each of the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Operations.html">actions and <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/proton/latest/APIReference/API_Types.html">data types for the AWS Proton service.
    The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML response.
    Alternatively, you can use the AWS CLI to access an API. For more information, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-welcome.html">AWS Command Line Interface User Guide.
    The AWS Proton service is a two-pronged automation framework. Administrators create service templates to provide standardized
    infrastructure and deployment tooling for serverless and container based applications. Developers, in turn, select from the available
    service templates to automate their application or service deployments.
    Because administrators define the infrastructure and tooling that AWS Proton deploys and manages, they need permissions to use all of the
    listed API operations.
    When developers select a specific infrastructure and tooling set, AWS Proton deploys their applications. To monitor their applications
    that are running on AWS Proton, developers need permissions to the service create, list,
    update and delete API operations and the service instance list and
    update API operations.
