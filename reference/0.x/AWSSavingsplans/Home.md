    Savings Plans are a pricing model that offer significant savings on AWS usage (for example, on Amazon EC2 instances). You commit to a consistent amount of usage, in USD per hour, for a term of 1 or 3 years, and receive a lower price for that usage. For more information, see the [AWS Savings Plans User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/savingsplans/latest/userguide/).
