    Welcome to the Amazon Route 53 Application Recovery Controller API Reference Guide for Recovery Control Data Plane . Recovery control in Route 53 Application Recovery Controller includes extremely reliable routing controls that enable you to recover applications by rerouting traffic, for example, across Availability Zones or AWS Regions. Routing controls are simple on/off switches hosted on a cluster. A cluster is a set of five redundant regional endpoints against which you can execute API calls to update or get the state of routing controls. You use routing controls to failover traffic to recover your application across Availability Zones or Regions. This API guide includes information about how to get and update routing control states in Route 53 Application Recovery Controller.
