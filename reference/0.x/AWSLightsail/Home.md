    Amazon Lightsail is the easiest way to get started with Amazon Web Services (AWS) for developers
    who need to build websites or web applications. It includes everything you need to launch your
    project quickly - instances (virtual private servers), container services, storage buckets,
    managed databases, SSD-based block storage, static IP addresses, load balancers, content
    delivery network (CDN) distributions, DNS management of registered domains, and resource
    snapshots (backups) - for a low, predictable monthly price.
