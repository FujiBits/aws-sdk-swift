    Use Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API to create, read, update, delete, and list (CRUD-L) your cloud resources that
    belong to a wide range of services--both Amazon Web Services and third-party.  With the Cloud Control API
    standardized set of application programming interfaces (APIs), you can perform CRUD-L operations
    on any supported resources in your Amazon Web Services account. Using Cloud Control API, you won't have to generate code
    or scripts specific to each individual service responsible for those resources.
    For more information about Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudcontrolapi/latest/userguide/what-is-cloudcontrolapi.html">Amazon Web Services Cloud Control API User
    Guide.
