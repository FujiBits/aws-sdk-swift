    IoT data enables secure, bi-directional communication between Internet-connected things (such as sensors,
    actuators, embedded devices, or smart appliances) and the Amazon Web Services cloud. It implements a broker for applications and
    things to publish messages over HTTP (Publish) and retrieve, update, and delete shadows. A shadow is a
    persistent representation of your things and their state in the Amazon Web Services cloud.
    Find the endpoint address for actions in IoT data by running this CLI command:
