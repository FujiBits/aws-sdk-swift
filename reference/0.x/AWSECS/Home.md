    <fullname>Amazon Elastic Container Service</fullname>
    Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) is a highly scalable, fast, container management service that makes
    it easy to run, stop, and manage Docker containers on a cluster. You can host your
    cluster on a serverless infrastructure that is managed by Amazon ECS by launching your
    services or tasks on Fargate. For more control, you can host your tasks on a cluster
    of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances that you manage.
    Amazon ECS makes it easy to launch and stop container-based applications with simple API
    calls, allows you to get the state of your cluster from a centralized service, and gives
    you access to many familiar Amazon EC2 features.
    You can use Amazon ECS to schedule the placement of containers across your cluster based on
    your resource needs, isolation policies, and availability requirements. Amazon ECS eliminates
    the need for you to operate your own cluster management and configuration management
    systems or worry about scaling your management infrastructure.
