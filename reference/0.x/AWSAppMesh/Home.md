    App Mesh is a service mesh based on the Envoy proxy that makes it easy to monitor and
    control microservices. App Mesh standardizes how your microservices communicate, giving you
    end-to-end visibility and helping to ensure high availability for your applications.
    App Mesh gives you consistent visibility and network traffic controls for every
    microservice in an application. You can use App Mesh with Amazon Web Services Fargate, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS,
    Kubernetes on Amazon Web Services, and Amazon EC2.
