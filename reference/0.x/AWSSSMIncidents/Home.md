    AWS Systems Manager Incident Manager is an incident management console designed to help
    users mitigate and recover from incidents affecting their AWS-hosted applications. An incident
    is any unplanned interruption or reduction in quality of services.
    Incident Manager increases incident resolution by notifying responders of impact,
    highlighting relevant troubleshooting data, and providing collaboration tools to get services
    back up and running. To achieve the primary goal of reducing the time-to-resolution of
    critical incidents, Incident Manager automates response plans and enables responder team
    escalation.
