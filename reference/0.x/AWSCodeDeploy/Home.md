    AWS CodeDeploy is a deployment service that automates application deployments to
    Amazon EC2 instances, on-premises instances running in your own facility, serverless AWS
    Lambda functions, or applications in an Amazon ECS service.
    You can deploy a nearly unlimited variety of application content, such as an updated
    Lambda function, updated applications in an Amazon ECS service, code, web and
    configuration files, executables, packages, scripts, multimedia files, and so on. AWS
    CodeDeploy can deploy application content stored in Amazon S3 buckets, GitHub
    repositories, or Bitbucket repositories. You do not need to make changes to your
    existing code before you can use AWS CodeDeploy.
    AWS CodeDeploy makes it easier for you to rapidly release new features, helps you
    avoid downtime during application deployment, and handles the complexity of updating
    your applications, without many of the risks associated with error-prone manual
    deployments.
