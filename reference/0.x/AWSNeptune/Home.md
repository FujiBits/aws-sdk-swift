    Amazon Neptune is a fast, reliable, fully-managed graph database service that makes it
    easy to build and run applications that work with highly connected datasets. The core of
    Amazon Neptune is a purpose-built, high-performance graph database engine optimized for
    storing billions of relationships and querying the graph with milliseconds latency. Amazon
    Neptune supports popular graph models Property Graph and W3C's RDF, and their respective query
    languages Apache TinkerPop Gremlin and SPARQL, allowing you to easily build queries that
    efficiently navigate highly connected datasets. Neptune powers graph use cases such as
    recommendation engines, fraud detection, knowledge graphs, drug discovery, and network
    security.
