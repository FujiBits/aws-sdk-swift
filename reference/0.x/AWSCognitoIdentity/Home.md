    Amazon Cognito Federated Identities is a web service that delivers scoped temporary
    credentials to mobile devices and other untrusted environments. It uniquely identifies a
    device and supplies the user with a consistent identity over the lifetime of an
    application.
    Using Amazon Cognito Federated Identities, you can enable authentication with one or
    more third-party identity providers (Facebook, Google, or Login with Amazon) or an Amazon
    Cognito user pool, and you can also choose to support unauthenticated access from your app.
    Cognito delivers a unique identifier for each user and acts as an OpenID token provider
    trusted by AWS Security Token Service (STS) to access temporary, limited-privilege AWS
    credentials.
    For a description of the authentication flow from the Amazon Cognito Developer Guide
