# Protocols

  - [AcmPcaClientProtocol](/aws-sdk-swift/reference/0.x/AWSACMPCA/AcmPcaClientProtocol):
    This is the ACM Private CA API Reference. It provides descriptions,
    syntax, and usage examples for each of the actions and data types involved in creating
    and managing private certificate authorities (CA) for your organization.
    The documentation for each action shows the Query API request parameters and the XML
    response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to access an API that's
    tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For more
    information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">AWS
    SDKs.
    Each ACM Private CA API operation has a quota that determines the number of times the operation
    can be called per second. ACM Private CA throttles API requests at different rates depending
    on the operation. Throttling means that ACM Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request
    because the request exceeds the operation's quota for the number of requests per second.
    When a request is throttled, ACM Private CA returns a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html">ThrottlingException error. ACM Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request
    rate for APIs.
