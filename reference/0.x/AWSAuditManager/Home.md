    Welcome to the Audit Manager API reference. This guide is for developers who need detailed information about the Audit Manager API operations, data types, and errors.
    Audit Manager is a service that provides automated evidence collection so that you
    can continuously audit your Amazon Web Services usage, and assess the effectiveness of your controls to
    better manage risk and simplify compliance.
    Audit Manager provides pre-built frameworks that structure and automate assessments
    for a given compliance standard. Frameworks include a pre-built collection of controls with
    descriptions and testing procedures, which are grouped according to the requirements of the
    specified compliance standard or regulation. You can also customize frameworks and controls
    to support internal audits with unique requirements.
