# Protocols

  - [EbsClientProtocol](/aws-sdk-swift/reference/0.x/AWSEBS/EbsClientProtocol):
    You can use the Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) direct APIs to create Amazon EBS snapshots, write data directly to
    your snapshots, read data on your snapshots, and identify the differences or changes between
    two snapshots. If youâ€™re an independent software vendor (ISV) who offers backup services for
    Amazon EBS, the EBS direct APIs make it more efficient and cost-effective to track incremental changes on
    your Amazon EBS volumes through snapshots. This can be done without having to create new volumes
    from snapshots, and then use Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances to compare the differences.
