    Amazon Web Services Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as collecting system inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed instances. A managed instance is any Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance (EC2 instance), or any on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) in your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems Manager. This reference is intended to be used with the [Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/). To get started, verify prerequisites and configure managed instances. For more information, see [Setting up Amazon Web Services Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html) in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.
