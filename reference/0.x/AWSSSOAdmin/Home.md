    Amazon Web Services Single Sign On (SSO) is a cloud SSO service that makes it easy to centrally manage SSO
    access to multiple Amazon Web Services accounts and business applications. This guide provides information on
    SSO operations which could be used for access management of Amazon Web Services accounts. For information about
    Amazon Web Services SSO features, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/what-is.html">Amazon Web Services Single Sign-On User Guide.
