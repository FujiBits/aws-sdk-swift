    You can use Amazon CloudWatch Synthetics to continually monitor your services. You can
    create and manage canaries, which are modular, lightweight scripts
    that monitor your endpoints and APIs
    from the outside-in. You can set up your canaries to run
    24 hours a day, once per minute. The canaries help you check the availability and latency
    of your web services and troubleshoot anomalies by investigating load time data,
    screenshots of the UI, logs, and metrics. The canaries seamlessly integrate with CloudWatch
    ServiceLens to help you trace the causes of impacted nodes in your applications. For more
    information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/ServiceLens.html">Using ServiceLens to Monitor
    the Health of Your Applications in the Amazon CloudWatch User
    Guide.
