    This is the Resource Access Manager API Reference. This documentation provides
    descriptions and syntax for each of the actions and data types in RAM. RAM is a
    service that helps you securely share your Amazon Web Services resources across Amazon Web Services accounts and
    within your organization or organizational units (OUs) in Organizations. For supported
    resource types, you can also share resources with IAM roles and IAM users. If you have
    multiple Amazon Web Services accounts, you can use RAM to share those resources with other
    accounts.
