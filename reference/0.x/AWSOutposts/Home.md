    AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, APIs, and tools
    to customer premises. By providing local access to AWS managed infrastructure, AWS Outposts
    enables customers to build and run applications on premises using the same programming
    interfaces as in AWS Regions, while using local compute and storage resources for lower
    latency and local data processing needs.
