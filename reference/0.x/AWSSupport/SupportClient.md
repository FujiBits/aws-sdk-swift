## Inheritance

[`SupportClientProtocol`](/aws-sdk-swift/reference/0.x/AWSSupport/SupportClientProtocol)

## Initializers

### `init(config:)`

public init(config: AWSClientRuntime.AWSClientConfiguration) 
```

### `init(region:)`

``` swift
public convenience init(region: Swift.String? = nil) throws

## Methods

### `addAttachmentsToSet(input:completion:)`

Adds one or more attachments to an attachment set.
An attachment set is a temporary container for attachments that you add to a case or
case communication. The set is available for 1 hour after it's created. The
expiryTime returned in the response is when the set expires.

``` swift
public func addAttachmentsToSet(input: AddAttachmentsToSetInput, completion: @escaping (ClientRuntime.SdkResult<AddAttachmentsToSetOutputResponse, AddAttachmentsToSetOutputError>) -> Void)
```

``` 
                You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support
                    API.


                If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a
                    Business or Enterprise Support plan, the
                        SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For
                    information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support.
```

### `addCommunicationToCase(input:completion:)`

Adds additional customer communication to an AWS Support case. Use the caseId
parameter to identify the case to which to add communication. You can list a set of
email addresses to copy on the communication by using the ccEmailAddresses
parameter. The communicationBody value contains the text of the
communication.

``` swift
public func addCommunicationToCase(input: AddCommunicationToCaseInput, completion: @escaping (ClientRuntime.SdkResult<AddCommunicationToCaseOutputResponse, AddCommunicationToCaseOutputError>) -> Void)
```

``` 
                You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support
                    API.


                If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a
                    Business or Enterprise Support plan, the
                        SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For
                    information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support.
```

### `createCase(input:completion:)`

Creates a case in the AWS Support Center. This operation is similar to how you create a case
in the AWS Support Center <a href="https:​//console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create">Create
Case page.
The AWS Support API doesn't support requesting service limit increases. You can submit a
service limit increase in the following ways:​

``` swift
public func createCase(input: CreateCaseInput, completion: @escaping (ClientRuntime.SdkResult<CreateCaseOutputResponse, CreateCaseOutputError>) -> Void)
```

``` 
            Submit a request from the AWS Support Center <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create">Create Case page.


            Use the Service Quotas <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/2019-06-24/apireference/API_RequestServiceQuotaIncrease.html">RequestServiceQuotaIncrease operation.


    A successful CreateCase request returns an AWS Support case number. You can use
        the DescribeCases operation and specify the case number to get
        existing AWS Support cases. After you create a case, use the AddCommunicationToCase operation to add additional communication or
        attachments to an existing case.
    The caseId is separate from the displayId that appears in
        the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/support">AWS Support Center. Use the DescribeCases operation to get the displayId.



                You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support
                    API.


                If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a
                    Business or Enterprise Support plan, the
                        SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For
                    information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support.
```

### `describeAttachment(input:completion:)`

Returns the attachment that has the specified ID. Attachments can include screenshots,
error logs, or other files that describe your issue. Attachment IDs are generated by the
case management system when you add an attachment to a case or case communication.
Attachment IDs are returned in the AttachmentDetails objects that are
returned by the DescribeCommunications operation.

``` swift
public func describeAttachment(input: DescribeAttachmentInput, completion: @escaping (ClientRuntime.SdkResult<DescribeAttachmentOutputResponse, DescribeAttachmentOutputError>) -> Void)
```

``` 
                You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support
                    API.

                    Business or Enterprise Support plan, the
                        SubscriptionRequiredException error message appears. For
                    information about changing your support plan, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/">AWS Support.
```

### `describeCases(input:completion:)`

Returns a list of cases that you specify by passing one or more case IDs. You can use
the afterTime and beforeTime parameters to filter the cases by
date. You can set values for the includeResolvedCases and
includeCommunications parameters to specify how much information to
return.
The response returns the following in JSON format:​

``` swift
public func describeCases(input: DescribeCasesInput, completion: @escaping (ClientRuntime.SdkResult<DescribeCasesOutputResponse, DescribeCasesOutputError>) -> Void)
```

``` 
            One or more <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awssupport/latest/APIReference/API_CaseDetails.html">CaseDetails data types.


            One or more nextToken values, which specify where to paginate the
                returned records represented by the CaseDetails objects.


    Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was created more than
        12 months ago, a request might return an error.



                You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support
                    API.


                If you call the AWS Support API from an account that does not have a
                    Business or Enterprise Support plan, the

```

### `describeCommunications(input:completion:)`

Returns communications and attachments for one or more support cases. Use the
afterTime and beforeTime parameters to filter by date. You
can use the caseId parameter to restrict the results to a specific
case.
Case data is available for 12 months after creation. If a case was created more than
12 months ago, a request for data might cause an error.
You can use the maxResults and nextToken parameters to
control the pagination of the results. Set maxResults to the number of
cases that you want to display on each page, and use nextToken to specify
the resumption of pagination.

``` swift
public func describeCommunications(input: DescribeCommunicationsInput, completion: @escaping (ClientRuntime.SdkResult<DescribeCommunicationsOutputResponse, DescribeCommunicationsOutputError>) -> Void)
```

``` 
                You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support

### `describeServices(input:completion:)`

Returns the current list of AWS services and a list of service categories for each

The service codes and category codes correspond to the values that appear in the
Service and Category lists on the AWS Support Center <a href="https:​//console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create">Create Case page. The values in those fields
don't necessarily match the service codes and categories returned by the
DescribeServices operation. Always use the service codes and categories
that the DescribeServices operation returns, so that you have the most
recent set of service and category codes.

``` swift
public func describeServices(input: DescribeServicesInput, completion: @escaping (ClientRuntime.SdkResult<DescribeServicesOutputResponse, DescribeServicesOutputError>) -> Void)
```

``` 
                You must have a Business or Enterprise Support plan to use the AWS Support
                    API.

```

### `describeSeverityLevels(input:completion:)`

Returns the list of severity levels that you can assign to a support case. The severity
level for a case is also a field in the CaseDetails data type that you
include for a CreateCase request.

``` swift
public func describeSeverityLevels(input: DescribeSeverityLevelsInput, completion: @escaping (ClientRuntime.SdkResult<DescribeSeverityLevelsOutputResponse, DescribeSeverityLevelsOutputError>) -> Void)
```

```
