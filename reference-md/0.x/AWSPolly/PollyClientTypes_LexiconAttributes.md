## Initializers

### `init(from:)`

``` swift
public init (from decoder: Swift.Decoder) throws 
```

### `init(alphabet:languageCode:lastModified:lexemesCount:lexiconArn:size:)`

``` swift
public init (
            alphabet: Swift.String? = nil,
            languageCode: PollyClientTypes.LanguageCode? = nil,
            lastModified: ClientRuntime.Date? = nil,
            lexemesCount: Swift.Int = 0,
            lexiconArn: Swift.String? = nil,
            size: Swift.Int = 0
        )
```

## Properties

### `debugDescription`

``` swift
public var debugDescription: Swift.String 
```

### `alphabet`

Phonetic alphabet used in the lexicon. Valid values are

``` swift
public var lexemesCount: Swift.Int
```

### `lexiconArn`

``` swift
public var lexiconArn: Swift.String?
```

### `size`

Total size of the lexicon, in characters.

``` swift
