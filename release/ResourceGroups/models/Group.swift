/// <p>A resource group that contains AWS resources. You can assign resources to the group
///             by associating either of the following elements with the group:</p>
///         <ul>
///             <li>
///                 <p>
///                   <a>ResourceQuery</a> - Use a resource query to specify a set of tag
///                     keys and values. All resources in the same AWS Region and AWS account that
///                     have those keys with the same values are included in the group. You can add a
///                     resource query when you create the group, or later by using the <a>PutGroupConfiguration</a> operation.</p>
///             </li>
///             <li>
///                 <p>
///                   <a>GroupConfiguration</a> - Use a service configuration to
///                     associate the group with an AWS service. The configuration specifies which
///                     resource types can be included in the group.</p>
