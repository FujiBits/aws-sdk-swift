///
///          AWS Application Discovery Service helps you plan application migration projects. It
///       automatically identifies servers, virtual machines (VMs), and network dependencies in your
///       on-premises data centers. For more information, see the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/application-discovery/faqs/">AWS Application Discovery Service
///         FAQ. Application Discovery Service offers three ways of performing discovery and
///       collecting data about your on-premises servers:
///
///
///
///
///                   Agentless discovery is recommended for environments
///           that use VMware vCenter Server. This mode doesn't require you to install an agent on each
///           host. It does not work in non-VMware environments.
///
///
///
///                      Agentless discovery gathers server information regardless of the operating
///               systems, which minimizes the time required for initial on-premises infrastructure
///               assessment.
///
///
///                      Agentless discovery doesn't collect information about network dependencies, only
///               agent-based discovery collects that information.
///
///
///
///
///
///
///
///
///                   Agent-based discovery collects a richer set of data
///           than agentless discovery by using the AWS Application Discovery Agent, which you install
///           on one or more hosts in your data center.
///
///
///
///                       The agent captures infrastructure and application information, including an
///               inventory of running processes, system performance information, resource utilization,
///               and network dependencies.
///
///
///                      The information collected by agents is secured at rest and in transit to the
///               Application Discovery Service database in the cloud.
///
///
///
///
///
///
///
///
///                   AWS Partner Network (APN) solutions integrate with
///           Application Discovery Service, enabling you to import details of your on-premises
///           environment directly into Migration Hub without using the discovery connector or discovery
///           agent.
///
///
///
///                      Third-party application discovery tools can query AWS Application Discovery
///               Service, and they can write to the Application Discovery Service database using the
///               public API.
///
///
///                      In this way, you can import data into Migration Hub and view it, so that you can
///               associate applications with servers and track migrations.
///
///
///
///
///
///
///
///             Recommendations
///
///          We recommend that you use agent-based discovery for non-VMware environments, and
///       whenever you want to collect information about network dependencies. You can run agent-based
///       and agentless discovery simultaneously. Use agentless discovery to complete the initial
///       infrastructure assessment quickly, and then install agents on select hosts to collect
///       additional information.
///
///
///             Working With This Guide
///
///
///          This API reference provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each of the
///       actions and data types for Application Discovery Service. The topic for each action shows the
///       API request parameters and the response. Alternatively, you can use one of the AWS SDKs to
///       access an API that is tailored to the programming language or platform that you're using. For
///       more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">AWS
///       SDKs.
///
///
///
///
///                   Remember that you must set your Migration Hub home region before you call any of
///             these APIs.
///
///
///                   You must make API calls for write actions (create, notify, associate, disassociate,
///             import, or put) while in your home region, or a HomeRegionNotSetException
///             error is returned.
///
///
///                   API calls for read actions (list, describe, stop, and delete) are permitted outside
///             of your home region.
///
///
///                   Although it is unlikely, the Migration Hub home region could change. If you call
///             APIs outside the home region, an InvalidInputException is returned.
///
///
///                   You must call GetHomeRegion to obtain the latest Migration Hub home
///             region.
