/// Amazon Augmented AI (Amazon A2I) adds the benefit of human judgment to any machine learning
///       application. When an AI application can't evaluate data with a high degree of confidence,
///       human reviewers can take over. This human review is called a human review workflow. To create
///       and start a human review workflow, you need three resources: a worker task
///         template, a flow definition, and a human
///         loop.
///          For information about these resources and prerequisites for using Amazon A2I, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-getting-started.html">Get Started with
///         Amazon Augmented AI in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
///          This API reference includes information about API actions and data types that you can use
///       to interact with Amazon A2I programmatically. Use this guide to:
///
///
///                Start a human loop with the StartHumanLoop operation when using
///           Amazon A2I with a custom task type. To learn more about the
///           difference between custom and built-in task types, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-task-types-general.html">Use Task Types . To learn
///           how to start a human loop using this API, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-start-human-loop.html#a2i-instructions-starthumanloop">Create and Start a Human Loop for a Custom Task Type  in the
///           Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
///
///
///                Manage your human loops. You can list all human loops that you have created, describe
///           individual human loops, and stop and delete human loops. To learn more, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/a2i-monitor-humanloop-results.html">Monitor and Manage Your Human Loop  in the Amazon SageMaker Developer Guide.
