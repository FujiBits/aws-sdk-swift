///             <li>
/// 				           <p>The request body and the URL path (without the domain name) from the viewer

///             <li>
/// 				           <p>The headers that CloudFront automatically includes in every origin request, including
/// 					<code>Host</code>, <code>User-Agent</code>, and <code>X-Amz-Cf-Id</code>.</p>
/// 			         </li>
///             <li>
/// 				           <p>All HTTP headers, cookies, and URL query strings that are specified in the
