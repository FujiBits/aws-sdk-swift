///
///             This is the latest version of the WAF API,
///             released in November, 2019. The names of the entities that you use to access this API,
///             like endpoints and namespaces, all have the versioning information added, like "V2" or
///             "v2", to distinguish from the prior version. We recommend migrating your resources to
///             this version, because it has a number of significant improvements.
///             If you used WAF prior to this release, you can't use this WAFV2 API to access any
///             WAF resources that you created before. You can access your old rules, web ACLs, and
///             other WAF resources only through the WAF Classic APIs. The WAF Classic APIs
///             have retained the prior names, endpoints, and namespaces.
///             For information, including how to migrate your WAF resources to this version,
///             see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-chapter.html">WAF Developer Guide.
///
///          WAF is a web application firewall that lets you monitor the HTTP and HTTPS
///          requests that are forwarded to Amazon CloudFront, an Amazon API Gateway REST API, an Application Load Balancer, or an AppSync
///          GraphQL API. WAF also lets you control access to your content. Based on conditions that
///          you specify, such as the IP addresses that requests originate from or the values of query
///          strings, the Amazon API Gateway REST API, CloudFront distribution, the Application Load Balancer, or the AppSync GraphQL
///          API responds to requests either with the requested content or with an HTTP 403 status code
///          (Forbidden). You also can configure CloudFront to return a custom error page when a request is
///          blocked.
///          This API guide is for developers who need detailed information about WAF API actions,
///          data types, and errors. For detailed information about WAF features and an overview of
///          how to use WAF, see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-waf.html">WAF Developer
///          Guide.
///          You can make calls using the endpoints listed in <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/waf.html">WAF endpoints and quotas.
///
///
///                For regional applications, you can use any of the endpoints in the list.
///                A regional application can be an Application Load Balancer (ALB), an Amazon API Gateway REST API, or an AppSync GraphQL API.
///
///
///                For Amazon CloudFront applications, you must use the API endpoint listed for
///                US East (N. Virginia): us-east-1.
///
///
///          Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services SDKs to access an API that's tailored to the
///          programming language or platform that you're using. For more information, see <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services SDKs.
///          We currently provide two versions of the WAF API: this API and the prior versions,
///          the classic WAF APIs. This new API provides the same functionality as the older versions,
///          with the following major improvements:
///
///
///                You use one API for both global and regional applications. Where you need to
///                distinguish the scope, you specify a Scope parameter and set it to
///                   CLOUDFRONT or REGIONAL.
///
///
///                You can define a web ACL or rule group with a single call, and update it with a
///                single call. You define all rule specifications in JSON format, and pass them to your
///                rule group or web ACL calls.
///
///
///                The limits WAF places on the use of rules more closely reflects the cost of
///                running each type of rule. Rule groups include capacity settings, so you know the
///                maximum cost of a rule group when you use it.
