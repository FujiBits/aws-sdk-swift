/// Amazon EMR on EKS provides a deployment option for Amazon EMR that allows you to run
///          open-source big data frameworks on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS). With
///          this deployment option, you can focus on running analytics workloads while Amazon EMR on
///          EKS builds, configures, and manages containers for open-source applications. For more
///          information about Amazon EMR on EKS concepts and tasks, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/emr-eks.html">What is Amazon EMR on EKS.
///
///             Amazon EMR containers is the API name for Amazon EMR on EKS. The
///             emr-containers prefix is used in the following scenarios:
///
///
///                It is the prefix in the CLI commands for Amazon EMR on EKS. For example, aws
///                   emr-containers start-job-run.
///
///
///                It is the prefix before IAM policy actions for Amazon EMR on EKS. For example, "Action": [
///             "emr-containers:StartJobRun"]. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html#security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions">Policy actions for Amazon EMR on EKS.
///
///
///                It is the prefix used in Amazon EMR on EKS service endpoints. For example, emr-containers.us-east-2.amazonaws.com. For more
///             information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/emr/latest/EMR-on-EKS-DevelopmentGuide/service-quotas.html#service-endpoints">Amazon EMR on EKS Service Endpoints.
