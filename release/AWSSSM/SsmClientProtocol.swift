/// Amazon Web Services Systems Manager is a collection of capabilities that helps you automate management tasks such as collecting system inventory, applying operating system (OS) patches, automating the creation of Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), and configuring operating systems (OSs) and applications at scale. Systems Manager lets you remotely and securely manage the configuration of your managed instances. A managed instance is any Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud instance (EC2 instance), or any on-premises server or virtual machine (VM) in your hybrid environment that has been configured for Systems Manager. This reference is intended to be used with the [Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/). To get started, verify prerequisites and configure managed instances. For more information, see [Setting up Amazon Web Services Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-setting-up.html) in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide.

    /// Adds or overwrites one or more tags for the specified resource. Tags are metadata that you can assign to your documents, managed instances, maintenance windows, Parameter Store parameters, and patch baselines. Tags enable you to categorize your resources in different ways, for example, by purpose, owner, or environment. Each tag consists of a key and an optional value, both of which you define. For example, you could define a set of tags for your account's managed instances that helps you track each instance's owner and stack level. For example:
    ///
    /// * Key=Owner,Value=DbAdmin
    ///
    /// * Key=Owner,Value=SysAdmin
    ///
    /// * Key=Owner,Value=Dev
    ///
    /// * Key=Stack,Value=Production
    ///
    /// * Key=Stack,Value=Pre-Production
    ///
    /// * Key=Stack,Value=Test
    ///
    ///
    /// Each resource can have a maximum of 50 tags. We recommend that you devise a set of tag keys that meets your needs for each resource type. Using a consistent set of tag keys makes it easier for you to manage your resources. You can search and filter the resources based on the tags you add. Tags don't have any semantic meaning to and are interpreted strictly as a string of characters. For more information about using tags with Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, see [Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide.

For static targets, the association specifies a schedule for when the configuration is reapplied. For dynamic targets, such as an Amazon Web Services resource group or an Amazon Web Services autoscaling group, State Manager, a capability of Amazon Web Services Systems Manager applies the configuration when new instances are added to the group. The association also specifies actions to take when applying the configuration. For example, an association for anti-virus software might run once a day. If the software isn't installed, then State Manager installs it. If the software is installed, but the service isn't running, then the association might instruct State Manager to start the service.

    /// A resource data sync helps you view data from multiple sources in a single location. Amazon Web Services Systems Manager offers two types of resource data sync: SyncToDestination and SyncFromSource. You can configure Systems Manager Inventory to use the SyncToDestination type to synchronize Inventory data from multiple Amazon Web Services Regions to a single Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket. For more information, see [Configuring resource data sync for Inventory](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/sysman-inventory-datasync.html) in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. You can configure Systems Manager Explorer to use the SyncFromSource type to synchronize operational work items (OpsItems) and operational data (OpsData) from multiple Amazon Web Services Regions to a single Amazon S3 bucket. This type can synchronize OpsItems and OpsData from multiple Amazon Web Services accounts and Amazon Web Services Regions or EntireOrganization by using Organizations. For more information, see [Setting up Systems Manager Explorer to display data from multiple accounts and Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/Explorer-resource-data-sync.html) in the Amazon Web Services Systems Manager User Guide. A resource data sync is an asynchronous operation that returns immediately. After a successful initial sync is completed, the system continuously syncs data. To check the status of a sync, use the [ListResourceDataSync]. By default, data isn't encrypted in Amazon S3. We strongly recommend that you enable encryption in Amazon S3 to ensure secure data storage. We also recommend that you secure access to the Amazon S3 bucket by creating a restrictive bucket policy.
