/// App Runner App Runner is an application service that provides a fast, simple, and cost-effective way to go directly from an existing container image or source code to a running service in the Amazon Web Services Cloud in seconds. You don't need to learn new technologies, decide which compute service to use, or understand how to provision and configure Amazon Web Services resources. App Runner connects directly to your container registry or source code repository. It provides an automatic delivery pipeline with fully managed operations, high performance, scalability, and security. For more information about App Runner, see the [App Runner Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/dg/). For release information, see the [App Runner Release Notes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apprunner/latest/relnotes/). To install the Software Development Kits (SDKs), Integrated Development Environment (IDE) Toolkits, and command line tools that you can use to access the API, see [Tools for Amazon Web Services](http://aws.amazon.com/tools/). Endpoints For a list of Region-specific endpoints that App Runner supports, see [App Runner endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/apprunner.html) in the Amazon Web Services General Reference.

After you call AssociateCustomDomain and receive a successful response, use the information in the [CustomDomain] record that's returned to add CNAME records to your Domain Name System (DNS). For each mapped domain name, add a mapping to the target App Runner subdomain and one or more certificate validation records. App Runner then performs DNS validation to verify that you own or control the domain name that you associated. App Runner tracks domain validity in a certificate stored in [AWS Certificate Manager (ACM)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide).

You can share an auto scaling configuration across multiple services. Create multiple revisions of a configuration by using the same AutoScalingConfigurationName and different AutoScalingConfigurationRevision values. When you create a service, you can set it to use the latest active revision of an auto scaling configuration or a specific revision. Configure a higher MinSize to increase the spread of your App Runner service over more Availability Zones in the Amazon Web Services Region. The tradeoff is a higher minimal cost. Configure a lower MaxSize to control your cost. The tradeoff is lower responsiveness during peak demand.
