///          Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for
///    developers, scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources. Batch uses the advantages of
///    this computing workload to remove the undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required
///    infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing software approach. Given these
///    advantages, Batch can help you to efficiently provision resources in response to jobs submitted, thus effectively
///    helping you to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver your results more quickly.
///          As a fully managed service, Batch can run batch computing workloads of any scale. Batch automatically
///    provisions compute resources and optimizes workload distribution based on the quantity and scale of your specific
///    workloads. With Batch, there's no need to install or manage batch computing software. This means that you can focus
///    your time and energy on analyzing results and solving your specific problems.

    ///          In a managed compute environment, Batch manages the capacity and instance types of the compute resources
    ///    within the environment. This is based on the compute resource specification that you define or the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-launch-templates.html">launch template that you
    ///    specify when you create the compute environment. Either, you can choose to use EC2 On-Demand Instances and EC2 Spot
    ///    Instances. Or, you can use Fargate and Fargate Spot capacity in your managed compute environment. You can
    ///    optionally set a maximum price so that Spot Instances only launch when the Spot Instance price is less than a
    ///    specified percentage of the On-Demand price.

    ///          In an unmanaged compute environment, you can manage your own EC2 compute resources and have a lot of flexibility
    ///    with how you configure your compute resources. For example, you can use custom AMIs. However, you must verify that
    ///    each of your AMIs meet the Amazon ECS container instance AMI specification. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/container_instance_AMIs.html">container instance
    ///     AMIs in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide. After you created your unmanaged compute environment, you
    ///    can use the DescribeComputeEnvironments operation to find the Amazon ECS cluster that's associated with
