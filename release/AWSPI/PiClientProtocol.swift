///          Amazon RDS Performance Insights enables you to monitor and explore different dimensions of
///       database load based on data captured from a running DB instance. The guide provides detailed
///       information about Performance Insights data types, parameters and errors.
///
///          When Performance Insights is enabled, the Amazon RDS Performance Insights API provides visibility into the performance of your DB instance. Amazon
///       CloudWatch provides the authoritative source for AWS service-vended monitoring metrics.  Performance Insights offers a domain-specific
///       view of DB load.
///          DB load is measured as Average Active Sessions. Performance Insights provides the data to API consumers as a two-dimensional
///       time-series dataset. The time dimension provides DB load data for each time point in the queried time range. Each time
///       point decomposes overall load in relation to the requested dimensions, measured at that time point. Examples include
///       SQL, Wait event, User, and Host.
///
