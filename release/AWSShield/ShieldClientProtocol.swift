You can associate up to 10 Amazon S3 buckets with your subscription. To use the services of the SRT and make an AssociateDRTLogBucket request, you must be subscribed to the [Business Support plan](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support/) or the [Enterprise Support plan](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/enterprise-support/).

This enables the SRT to inspect your WAF configuration and create or update WAF rules and web ACLs. You can associate only one RoleArn with your subscription. If you submit an AssociateDRTRole request for an account that already has an associated role, the new RoleArn will replace the existing RoleArn. Prior to making the AssociateDRTRole request, you must attach the [AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy) managed policy to the role you will specify in the request. For more information see [Attaching and Detaching IAM Policies](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html). The role must also trust the service principal  drt.shield.amazonaws.com. For more information, see [IAM JSON Policy Elements: Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html). The SRT will have access only to your WAF and Shield resources. By submitting this request, you authorize the SRT to inspect your WAF and Shield configuration and create and update WAF rules and web ACLs on your behalf. The SRT takes these actions only if explicitly authorized by you. You must have the iam:PassRole permission to make an AssociateDRTRole request. For more information, see [Granting a User Permissions to Pass a Role to an Amazon Web Services Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html).
