    /// Authorizes the Shield Response Team (SRT) to access the specified Amazon S3 bucket containing log data such as Application Load Balancer access logs, CloudFront logs, or logs from third party sources. You can associate up to 10 Amazon S3 buckets with your subscription. To use the services of the SRT and make an AssociateDRTLogBucket request, you must be subscribed to the [Business Support plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support/) or the [Enterprise Support plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/enterprise-support/).

This enables the SRT to inspect your WAF configuration and create or update WAF rules and web ACLs. You can associate only one RoleArn with your subscription. If you submit an AssociateDRTRole request for an account that already has an associated role, the new RoleArn will replace the existing RoleArn. Prior to making the AssociateDRTRole request, you must attach the AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy managed policy to the role that you'll specify in the request. You can access this policy in the IAM console at [AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/policies/arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSShieldDRTAccessPolicy). For more information see [Adding and removing IAM identity permissions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-attach-detach.html). The role must also trust the service principal drt.shield.amazonaws.com. For more information, see [IAM JSON policy elements: Principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html). The SRT will have access only to your WAF and Shield resources. By submitting this request, you authorize the SRT to inspect your WAF and Shield configuration and create and update WAF rules and web ACLs on your behalf. The SRT takes these actions only if explicitly authorized by you. You must have the iam:PassRole permission to make an AssociateDRTRole request. For more information, see [Granting a user permissions to pass a role to an Amazon Web Services service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_use_passrole.html). To use the services of the SRT and make an AssociateDRTRole request, you must be subscribed to the [Business Support plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/business-support/) or the [Enterprise Support plan](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/enterprise-support/).

For information about how automatic mitigation works and the requirements for using it, see [Shield Advanced automatic application layer DDoS mitigation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/ddos-advanced-automatic-app-layer-response.html). Don't use this action to make changes to automatic mitigation settings when it's already enabled for a resource. Instead, use [UpdateApplicationLayerAutomaticResponse]. To use this feature, you must associate a web ACL with the protected resource. The web ACL must be created using the latest version of WAF (v2). You can associate the web ACL through the Shield Advanced console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/wafv2/shieldv2#/). For more information, see [Getting Started with Shield Advanced](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/getting-started-ddos.html). You can also do this through the WAF console or the WAF API, but you must manage Shield Advanced automatic mitigation through Shield Advanced. For information about WAF, see [WAF Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/).
